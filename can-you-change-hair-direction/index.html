<p>Unfortunately, you can�t change the direction of the growth pattern with anything short of cosmetic surgery to turn that portion of the scalp. “you can alter these growth directions by maintaining consistent and gentle tension in the desired direction.” that means regularly combing your hair in the direction you want it. After a few days of regular care and attention, your hair should begin to take the shape you want. I override all of that by using hair products.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-hair-could-settle-in-the-new-direction-without-converting-back-to-its-original-direction-water-alone-is-enough-to-do-the-job">If your hair could settle in the new direction without converting back to its original direction, water alone is enough to do the job.</h3><p>Start by brushing your eyebrow hairs in the direction they grow, they use tweezers and scissors to carefully trim and tweeze your brows to achieve the shape you want. I was at the art of shaving today and i was told that by shaving against the grain it can mess up the direction of hair growth. This step is important because it�s the steam that�s going to set the new hair parting. The direction in which you shave your beards has nothing to do with the direction in which it grows. Maintain effective and safe methods of working when setting and dressing hair; Glide the razor in the opposite direction of your hair growth.</p>
