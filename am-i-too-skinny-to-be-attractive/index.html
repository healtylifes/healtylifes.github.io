<p>Mature big tits dirty talk. Those who perceive themselves as more independent, resourceful and protective prefer people who look, say, more emaciated because those are the people who are going to benefit from such a pairing the most. So, “kill �em with attitude” ! Because i recognize that all women do not look like me, and many would not want to.</p>
<h3 id="omg-if-only-i-could-be-her-size">Omg if only i could be her size!</h3><p>Reasons why betterme is a safe bet: If i�m happy with myself then you need to shut your mouth and respect that. It will never need good enough for others. If you feel bad at that weight then yes, by all means gain some weight, if you feel good and that�s where your weight naturally settles even when you�re eating a balanced diet, then it�s more a personal choice if you want to gain or not. I don�t think there is one universal way to tell if a person is too skinny and it depends a lot on an individual person�s preferences, as well as many factors, such as where a person carries weight. Because i recognize that all women do not look like me, and many would not want to.</p>
