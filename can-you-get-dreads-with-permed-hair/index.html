<p>You want the hair to really lock and when you perm the hair and you do this dread perming as you get the runoff, as you rinse out the actual chemical, the hair and the chemical kind of just lock together and that causes you to get a tighter lock on a softer texture of hair. The good news is.</p>

<p>The downsides to dread perms are price, unnecessary hair damage if it�s done improperly and simple fact that you still have to learn how to properly maintain them or they will simply grow out. Backcombing and the twist and rip are 2 methods that you can use to start dreading your hair,. We use a comb, hands and perm solution.</p>

<p>If you have straightened your hair and you’ll like to dread it you can use the backcombing method to lock the hair before the perm grows out.
